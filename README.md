## Installation
Download a binary suitable for your OS at the [releases page](https://github.com/profclems/compozify/releases/latest).

### From source

#### Prerequisites for building from source
- `make`
- Go 1.18+

1. Verify that you have Go 1.18+ installed

   ```sh
   go version
   ```

   If `go` is not installed, follow instructions on [the Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

2. Clone this repository

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/profclems/compozify.git
   cd compozify
   ```
   If you have `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` in your `$PATH`, you can just install with `make install` (install compozify in `$GOPATH/bin`) and **skip steps 3 and 4**.

3. Build the project
   ```sh
   make build
   ```

4. Change PATH to find newly compiled `compozify`

   ```sh
   export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
   ```

4. Run `compozify --version` to confirm that it worked
