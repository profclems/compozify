# Installation

Download a binary suitable for your OS at the [releases page](https://github.com/profclems/compozify/releases/latest).

## From source

### Prerequisites for building from source

- `make`
- Go 1.18+

1. Verify that you have Go 1.18+ installed

```sh
go version
```

If `go` is not installed, follow instructions on [the Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

2. Clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/profclems/compozify.git
```

3. Change directory to project

```sh
cd compozify
```

If you have `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` in your `$PATH`, you can just install with `make install` (install compozify in `$GOPATH/bin`) and **skip steps 3 and 4**.

4. Build the project

```sh
make build
```

5. Change PATH to find newly compiled `compozify`

```sh
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

6. Run `compozify --version` to confirm that it worked
